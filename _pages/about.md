I am a researcher in the [CELESTE](https://www.inria.fr/en/celeste) team of [INRIA Paris-Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre), located in the [Laboratoire Mathématique d'Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/). I am working on different aspects of the theory of machine learning, mostly focusing on the theoretical understanding of neural networks and relations between online learning and game theory.

From October 2021 to March 2023, I was a postdoc in the [Theory of Machine Learning Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/tml/) at EPFL with [Nicolas Flammarion](https://people.epfl.ch/nicolas.flammarion).

In 2021, I completed a PhD at ENS Paris-Saclay, started in September 2018 under the supervision of [Vianney Perchet](https://vianney.ai) and entitled "Statistical Learning in a strategical environment". I studied multi-agent learning, combining (online) learning with game theoretical tools. In particular, I mainly focused on the problem of Multiplayer Multi-armed bandits.

Have a look at my (hopefully updated) [CV](http://eboursier.github.io/files/boursier_cv.pdf) for additional information!

If you are interested in an internship/PhD/postdoc with me on deep learning theory related topics, please do not hesitate to contact me by email.
